    <p1 id="p2">The PCB is a printed circuit board that connects keyboard input to the computer. It’s best to choose one after deciding on the layout you want to use. One thing to note is that hot-swappable PCBs can easily switch between different switches without soldering while a normal PCB will be more secure but also more permanent. If you want access to cool lighting effects on your keyboard, RGB support is also something to look for. Some offer the ability to completely customize the keys’ function while others are simpler for those who aren’t concerned with the programmability of a keyboard.
