    <h3 id="h3">Cases</h3>
    <p1 id="p1">Keyboard cases are usually plastic or aluminum. They are both long-lasting, with aluminum being slightly better in longevity. Both materials come with pros and cons. The plastic case will be lighter, portable, and cheaper. The aluminum case will be heavier and more expensive but have better quality. They also can affect the sound profile, as plastic cases create a deeper sound and aluminum cases create a higher sound.

    <h3 id="h3">Plates</h3>
    <p1 id="p1">The material of the plate also affects the sound and feel of a mechanical keyboard. There are two categories that plates fall under; dense and flexible. The denser the material is, the higher the sound profile will be. Dense plates also have a stiff typing experience. Flexible plates offer a deeper sound profile and a generally better typing experience due to the flexibility. The three most common choices are aluminum, polycarbonate, and brass. Brass is a dense plate, polycarbonate is a flexible plate, and aluminum is somewhere in between.
